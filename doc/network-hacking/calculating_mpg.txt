Calculating MPG - based on two scenarios - whether you  have MAF senasor or not. 


MAF Sensor:


MPG = (14.7 * 6.17 * 454 * VSS * 0.621371) / (3600 * MAF / 100)
= 710.7 * VSS / MAF

14.7 - grams of air to 1 gram of gasoline - ideal air/fuel ratio
6.17 - pounds per gallon - density of gasoline
4.54 - grams per pound - conversion
VSS - vehicle speed in kilometers per hour
0.621371 - miles per hour/kilometers per hour - conversion
3600 - seconds per hour - conversion
MAF - mass air flow rate in 100 grams per second
100 - to correct MAF to give grams per second

No MAF (Uses MAP and Intake Temp to approximate MAF):

IMAP = RPM * MAP / IAT
MAF = (IMAP/120)*(VE/100)*(ED)*(MM)/(R)

MAP - Manifold Absolute Pressure in kPa
IAT - Intake Air Temperature in Kelvin
R - Specific Gas Constant (8.314 JM/K)
MM - Average molecular mass of air (28.97 g/M)
VE - volumetric efficiency measured in percent
ED - Engine Displacement in liters

This method requires tweaking of the VE for accuracy.

I have no idea if these are the methods the SGII uses. The accuracy will be off due to approximations (AFR ~14.7, etc). All the information is from the brilliant mind of Bruce Lightner.
